<h3>Algorithm Steps</h3>
<br>
1. Select the start node.
<br>
2. Visit the start node.
<br>
3. Explore the neighbors of the start node.
<br>
4. If there are undiscovered neighbor nodes, switch to that node and repeat the steps recursively.
<br>
5. When there are no undiscovered neighbor nodes, go back and return to the previous node.
<br>
6. Repeat the steps until all nodes have been visited.
